# hello-world

well this is my first repository...
I am an undergraduate from BUCT majoring in ploymer material. Now I am at grade Two.
I have to say I love coding. and I'd like to change my major to something about computer science in graduate level.
Here, the journey begin.

I can code in Python and C and I love them. So if anyone have the same sence with me, let's chat and communicating.
